Ingredients

    1/2 cup butter
    2 ounces unsweetened baking chocolate
    2 ounces semi-sweet chocolate
    2 eggs
    1 cup sugar
    2 teaspoons vanilla
    2/3 cup flour
    1 pinch salt
    1/2 cup Daisy Sour Cream
    1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions

Melt the butter and both chocolates over a double boiler and cool to room temperature. Beat the eggs and sugar together in a large bowl. Add the vanilla to the sugar mixture and then fold in the cooled chocolate mixture. Fold the flour, salt and sour cream into the batter. Add the nuts, if desired, and bake at 350 degrees in a well-greased 8x8-inch pan for 25-30 minutes. *Microwaves can be used instead of a double boiler for melting butter and chocolates, if desired in step one.
